Support Packages
===============
These are a set of support packages for:

* Creating a Binary Debian package - direct from a JAR file (needs testing)
* Test LOD packages:
  * Using piuparts to test the install/purge of a package into a chroot
  * Calling lintian on the packages
  * Creating a summary report for each attempt

Note: Structure is based on the rdf-dataset-integration package.
